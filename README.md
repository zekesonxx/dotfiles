# Zeke's Dotfiles

I probably should've done this a while ago.

As per usual for these repos, these are my configs, they may or may not 
work for you, and they very well could blow up your computer.

## Setup

Run `linkit.sh` in the dotfiles directory to link things to where they 
live. This is of course not required, and you're welcome to do whatever 
the hell you want with them.
